    An intervention is an object which manipulates the input configuration of the scenario-under-test. It must define
    a method which takes the input configuration, does something to it, and returns a modified input configuration.

    This provides a causal test case with two input configurations to compare: a control input configuration (the
    original) and a treatment input configuration (the modified). The causal test case then requires data for the
    execution of each of these input configurations to obtain the causal effect of this intervention.
